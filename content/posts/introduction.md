 I think that the main mistake I made with my previous "math blog" is that I miscalculated my desire to write long, drawn out mathematical arguments in the context of a blog post, 
 when such things would be much better suited for a set of lecture notes. 
 
 A blog should probably be a bit more whimsical, concise, and conversational: that is what I'm hoping to achieve here. 
 I probably won't even talk exclusively about math, although I am a (baby) graduate student in mathematics at UChicago, so alas, mathematics more or less dominates my life. Having said that, this 
 will be a forum for shorter, perhaps even incomplete thoughts, my general thoughts and experiences pursuing a PhD in mathematics, and I'm sure much more.

For the time-being, I'm taking some cores during my first semester. It's a lot of review, I've taken a lot of these courses before, particularly the analysis and topology, so the main 
challenge right now is representation theory (it's quite hard). I'm also doing a reading course this semester with one of the topologists here. I'm having a lot of fun reading about 4-manifolds and 
mapping class groups. The university is amazing: I love my office, I love the library, I love the people. I haven't felt this manic about mathematics in a while (my routine probably needs to improve 
a bit: I've been neglecting sleep and exercise in favour of reading my math books into the night).

I'm probably going to write more about my plans for what I hope to learn/accomplish this semester later this weekend.

 What a semester it has been so far. It's very busy, but I am thoroughly enjoying myself and my new life here in Chicago. With that being said: I've still got to do more.
 
 We met with Benson a couple days ago, and the expectation is that we will move through this mapping class group material very quickly. I'm trying to backfill some of the main proofs
 which are glossed over in the book, but this takes time, and I'm not going fast enough. 
 I'm mostly focusing on reading this book right now, but there are a million other things I feel like I should be doing, not limited to:

- Learning the more advanced toolkit of Riemannian geometry techniques that Neves was talking about when I met him
- Reading about 4-manifolds, gauge theory, etc. specifically Gompf and Stipsicz's book
- Reading McDuff and Salamon's book
- Learning about characteristic classes, topological $K$-theory
- Spending more time actually becoming comfortable with representation theory
- Actually properly learning how to do calculations with cohomology rings, learning higher homotopy theory properly

This list is nowhere close to complete. How do I start working 30 hour days? Something something bending the spacetime-continuum surely...

I think I should probably have maximum comfort with all of the material in Bott and Tu, as well as Milnor and Stasheff: this stuff is just so outrageously important, 
and my knowledge on anything characteristic class-adjacent is sorely lacking. I'll probably try to grind out big chunks of these books and the exercises during any tiny 
crumb of spare time I might have over the semester. Then, I'll probably make a big push in December, after classes have ended and I'm back in Canada lying around/eating 
Christmas cookies, with nothing better to do.
